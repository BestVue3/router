Declarative routing fro Vue3

# Why another Router Library

Vue community already had an official router library. So why another one?

The main reasoin is that we think Vue official is far too conservative. Vue3 contain a great composition API which have a lot of benefits then option API, but in order to be compatible with Vue2, Vue3 keep the option API and also Vue-Router will do the same thing.

In our opinion, option API is a **bad pratice** rather then a **not very good pratice**. So we decided to make some change for Vue3 community. It start with PureVue router, and it really just a start, we will try to do a lot things to improve the quality of Vue3 community in the future.
